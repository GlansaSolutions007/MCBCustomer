### Issue: "Crop Failed"
**Solution**:

- Restart the app and try again

## 📱 Expected Behavior

2. **Crop Modal**: Should open with image preview and controls
3. **Crop Adjustment**: Should respond to +/- button presses
4. **Apply Crop**: Should crop the image and close the modal

## 🔍 Debug Information

The app now includes console logging:
```javascript
console.error('Crop Error:', e);
```

Check the console for any error messages if issues persist.

## 🎯 Next Steps

If you're still experiencing issues:

1. **Check Console**: Look for error messages in the debug console
2. **Test with Different Images**: Try with various image sizes and formats
3. **Restart App**: Sometimes a fresh start helps
4. **Check Permissions**: Ensure camera/gallery permissions are granted

The crop functionality should now work smoothly with proper error handling and user feedback!
