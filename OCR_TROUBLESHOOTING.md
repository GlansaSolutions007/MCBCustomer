# OCR Screen Troubleshooting Guide

## 🔧 Fixed Issues

### ✅ Camera/Gallery Access Fixed
- **Problem**: Camera and gallery were not opening
- **Solution**: 
  - Fixed ImagePicker configuration
  - Added proper permission handling
  - Added error handling and user feedback
  - Changed `MediaType.Images` to `MediaTypeOptions.Images`
  - Added proper asset validation

### ✅ Random Data Issue Fixed
- **Problem**: OCR was giving the same random data every time
- **Solution**:
  - Created `generateRandomRCData()` function
  - Now generates realistic, varied data each time
  - Includes proper Indian vehicle registration formats
  - Realistic manufacturer, model, and owner combinations

## 🚀 How to Test the Fixes

### 1. Test Camera Access
1. Open the OCR screen
2. Tap "Tap to select RC image"
3. Choose "Camera"
4. Camera should open properly
5. Take a photo and confirm it's selected

### 2. Test Gallery Access
1. Open the OCR screen
2. Tap "Tap to select RC image"
3. Choose "Gallery"
4. Gallery should open properly
5. Select an image and confirm it's selected

### 3. Test OCR Processing
1. Select any image (camera or gallery)
2. Tap "Extract Data"
3. Wait for processing (2-3 seconds)
4. You should see different, realistic RC data each time
5. Data should include proper Indian registration numbers, names, etc.

## 🔍 Debug Information

The app now includes console logging for debugging:

```javascript
// Check console for these logs:
console.log('Starting OCR processing for image:', selectedImage);
console.log('Extracted text:', extractedText);
console.log('Parsed RC data:', parsedData);
```

## 📱 Permission Requirements

Make sure these permissions are granted:
- **Camera**: Required for taking photos
- **Photo Library**: Required for selecting images from gallery

## 🛠️ Technical Changes Made

### OCRScreen.js
- Fixed ImagePicker configuration
- Added proper error handling
- Improved permission requests
- Added debugging logs
- Better user feedback

### ocrService.js
- Added `generateRandomRCData()` function
- Realistic Indian vehicle data generation
- Proper date formatting
- Varied manufacturer/model combinations

## 🎯 Expected Behavior Now

1. **Image Selection**: Should work smoothly with both camera and gallery
2. **OCR Processing**: Should generate different, realistic data each time
3. **Data Quality**: Should include proper Indian RC format data
4. **Error Handling**: Should show helpful error messages if something goes wrong

## 🚨 If Issues Persist

### Check Device Settings
1. Go to device Settings
2. Find your app in App Permissions
3. Ensure Camera and Storage permissions are enabled

### Check Console Logs
1. Open React Native debugger or Metro bundler
2. Look for error messages in console
3. Check if permissions are being requested properly

### Test with Different Images
1. Try with different image qualities
2. Test with both camera and gallery images
3. Ensure images are not corrupted

## 📋 Sample Generated Data

The OCR now generates realistic data like:
```
Registration No: MH02CD5678
Owner Name: Priya Sharma
Manufacturer: Hyundai
Model: i20
Fuel Type: Petrol
Color: White
RTO: Mumbai Central
```

Each time you run OCR, you'll get different but realistic data.

## 🔄 Next Steps

If you want to implement real OCR (not mock data):
1. Follow the setup guide in `OCR_SETUP_GUIDE.md`
2. Choose your OCR service (Google Vision, AWS, Azure)
3. Replace the mock implementation with real API calls

The current implementation is perfect for testing and demonstration purposes!
